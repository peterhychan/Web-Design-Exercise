		<p>Hello, world ! When I was young, I played with my little digital gadget---Digivice, all the time. Since then, I was inspried to appreicate the beauty and joy of technology. After graduation from college, instead of being an anlyst in banking industry, I decided to switch my career path to software development. Web development is a good starting point for me. I enjoy learning data structure and algorithm along with various web development libraries and frameworks.  </p>
